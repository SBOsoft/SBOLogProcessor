# SBOLogProcessor
Access Log Processor and Metrics Generator

There are 3 main use cases (profiles) supported by this tool:

 1. Counter mode (when -p=count option is provided): Counts logs from an access log file and prints statistics to stdout every 30 seconds.  For example, running `sbologp -p count /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log` will print stats from /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log file every 30 seconds.
 2. Metrics generator (when -p=metrics option is provided): Processes logs from an access log file (or files) and generates metrics, which can be saved into a mysql database to be used with [SBOanalytics](https://github.com/SBOsoft/SBOanalytics) (web front-end for metrics) or just printed to stdout. Optionally processed (and optionally filtered) logs can be pushed to a mysql server, later to be viewed using SBOanalytics.
 3. Security mode (when -p=security option is provided): (**Not implemented yet**) Processes logs from an access log file and outputs potential security issues (e.g abuser, stats on sql injection attempts etc) giving you a list of IPs and/or patterns that you may want to block

#Â Usage 

## Binary releases
Download a precompiled binary from [releases](https://github.com/SBOsoft/SBOLogProcessor/releases) page, unzip/untar and execute sbologp (or sbologp.exe on windows) command.

## Command line options and configuration

Run `sbologp -h` to see available command line options.

There are too many options which may not have a corresponding command line parameter so if you need more control, passing a configuration file using -c option might be required.

See https://github.com/SBOsoft/SBOLogProcessor/tree/main/conf/example-config-file.json for configuration examples.
Configuration must be a json map, with file paths as keys. 

For more details on configuration options, see comments for `type ConfigForAMonitoredFile struct ` near the bottom of 
https://github.com/SBOsoft/SBOLogProcessor/blob/main/main.go.

## Example commands
Examples assume you are running a linux, e.g ubuntu.

### Counter mode
Run in counter mode and follow changes, prints stats every 30 seconds:

```./sbologp -f -p=count /var/log/apache2/access.log```

Run in counter mode without following changes, prints total stats:

```./sbologp -p=count /var/log/apache2/access.log```


### Metrics 

Run in the background using configuration file:

```nohup ./sbologp -f -c sbologp-config.json &```

nohup will ensure the program continues to run in the background even after your session ends, e.g your ssh connection is disconnected.


# Development

Install go first, then clone the project from github.

## Build

Build
```go build -o ./output/bin/sbologp```

Clean
```go clean```

## Run using go
Use `go run . -option1 -option2 path-to-access-log-file`  

For example: 
```go run . -f -h=COUNTER -p=count /var/log/apache2/access.log```


### Counter mode

Print stats from the given log file every 30 seconds (follow changes).

```go run . -f -p count /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log```

Print total stats from the given log file.

```go run . -p count /var/log/apache2/example.com-access.log```

### Run tests

`go test ./...` in project root folder or `go test ./...` in a sub-folder.

Do NOT expect high test coverage.
